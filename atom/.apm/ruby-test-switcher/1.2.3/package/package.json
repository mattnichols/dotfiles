Source files are opened to the left, test files to the right. *\n\n\\* Notice that if the target file is already opened, both commands simply switch to it.\n\n## Installation\n\nFrom the command line:\n\n```\n$ apm install ruby-test-switcher\n```\n\nFrom Atom's GUI:\n\n    Settings/Preferences ➔ Install ➔ `ruby-test-switcher`\n\n---\nInspired by the awesome [Sublime Text 2 Ruby Tests](https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dcarral/atom-ruby-test-switcher/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/dcarral/atom-ruby-test-switcher#readme","_id":"ruby-test-switcher@1.2.3","_shasum":"e37cf80298297947db26cd5509b4195806988941","_resolved":"file:../d-117024-80131-wvovr2/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117024-80131-wvovr2/package.tgz"}
